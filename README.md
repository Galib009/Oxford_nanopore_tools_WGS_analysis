# Oxford Nanopore Technology tools and codes
Basic tools and codes for analysis of whole genome sequences(WGS) from ONT platform

 - Guppy
 
    Guppy is a tool to covert fast5 files which are the output data type from ONT, to fastq files. Generally it is done using the Minknow GUI software. However, the command line tool can utilize the Nvidia graphics card of a computer and thus works 4-5 times faster.
 - Unzip_cat_zip 

    Basic Unzipping, concatenation and then zipping codes for making this ready for the tool Flye
 - [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye)

    Flye is a de novo assembler for single-molecule sequencing reads, such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

- [Racon](https://github.com/isovic/racon) 

    Racon is a standalone consensus module to correct raw contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a consensus step.
- [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka)

    medaka is a tool to create consensus sequences and variant calls from nanopore sequencing data.
